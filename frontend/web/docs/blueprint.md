## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Royal blue (#2563EB), conveying trust and security, aligning with financial services. It is used for main interactive elements such as primary buttons and active states.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F9FAFB), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that helps to focus attention on the content.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#10B981), used for secondary actions and highlights, creating a vibrant but balanced contrast.
- Headings font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) bold for headings. A modern, clear font, used for titles to ensure readability and create a strong visual hierarchy.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) regular for body text. Consistent font choice that works for both headlines and body provides simplicity for the prototype. Consistent readability at different sizes makes it easy to scan content quickly.
- Use consistent and clear icons to represent different credential types, connection statuses, and actions throughout the wallet. Icons should align with a modern design language to communicate function intuitively.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout using a 3-column structure for desktop and adapting to single-column on mobile. A clear, consistent layout should prioritize ease of navigation and readability across devices.
